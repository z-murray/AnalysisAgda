# AnalysisAgda
For my summer project, I am implementing as much of Errett Bishop's constructive analysis in Agda as possible. This is a solo project. Others are not allowed to edit this repository, even if it becomes public. It's listed here for version control and for anyone interested in seeing it.

Possible Questions and Answers:

(Q) What are your text references?
(A) See Errett Bishop's _Foundations of Constructive Analysis,_ or _Constructive Analysis_ by Errett Bishop and Douglas Bridges.

(Q) What Agda version and what library are you using?
(A) I'm using Agda 2.6.1.3 and the version of the Agda standard library available as of 13.05.2021.

(Q) Why constructive analysis instead of classical analysis?
(A) Two reasons. One, Agda is a proof assistant based on a constructive type theory, so the law of the excluded middle is not valid. I could probably add excluded middle as a posutlate, but that brings me to the second reason: I haven't learned constructive analysis yet, so I thought it'd be fun to learn.
