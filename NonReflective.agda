{-
This module is almost exactly the same as the Tactic.RingSolver.NonReflective in
the Agda Standard Library as of commit 84dcc85. The key difference is that our
version allows the user to use a coefficient ring other than the carrier ring
(given via homomorphism), while theirs does not.

Without this change, the solver does not function well with real numbers since
we are forced to use the reals as the coefficient ring and the carrier ring.
Using the rationals for coefficients fixes our problems.

We are using the ⊖ notation instead of ⊝ (notice the former has a longer line) because
of a parsing error when using the latter.
